# 🧠 Machine Learning Models for Architecture and Automotive Analytics

This repository contains two machine learning models:

1. 🏢 **Energy Efficiency Prediction** — Predicts the energy efficiency rating of buildings based on features such as wall area, roof area, height, and glazing.
2. 🚗 **Vehicle Clustering** — Groups vehicles into clusters using unsupervised learning based on attributes like weight, engine size, and horsepower.

Both models use **synthetic data** and are implemented using Python and common machine learning libraries.

## 📊 1. Energy Efficiency Prediction (Regression)

**Scenario:**  
You're working for an architecture firm to build a model that predicts a building’s energy efficiency score based on its design parameters.

### Features Used:
- `WallArea`
- `RoofArea`
- `OverallHeight`
- `GlazingArea`

### Target:
- `EnergyEfficiency` (synthetic score from 10 to 50)

## 🚗 Vehicle Clustering Model

This script clusters vehicles based on `Weight`, `EngineSize`, and `Horsepower` using **KMeans** clustering.
